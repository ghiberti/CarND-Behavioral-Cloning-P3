# Behaviorial Cloning Project

This project contains code and media related to the "Behavioral Clonning" project for Udacity Self Driving Car NanoDegree.

The goals / steps of this project are the following:

Use the simulator to collect data of good driving behavior 
Design, train and validate a model that predicts a steering angle from image data
Use the model to drive the vehicle autonomously around the first track in the simulator. The vehicle should remain on the road for an entire loop around the track.
Summarize the results with a written report

Contents:

model.py - script used to create and train the model
drive.py - script to drive the car
model.h5 - a trained Keras model
run1.mp4 - video of trained model executing a lap around the track
/examples - contains images used in writeup
project_writeup.md - contains project pipeline summary and reflections on the project outcome
